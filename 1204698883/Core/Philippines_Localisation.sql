Eventually, much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines.

Balangays were often made from an indigenous hardwood known as Doongon providing a rigid and durable frame that was augmented by the addition of rib-like structures inside the vessel.

	"Karakoa were large outrigger warships from the Philippines. They were used by native Filipinos, notably the Kapampangans and the Visayans, during seasonal sea raids. Karakoa were distinct from other traditional Philippine sailing vessels in that they were equipped with platforms for transporting warriors and for fighting at sea. During peacetime, they were also used as trading ships. Large karakoa, which could carry hundreds of rowers and warriors, were known as joangas (also spelled juangas) by the Spanish. By the end of the 16th century, the Spanish denounced karakoa ship-building and its usage. It later led to a total ban of the ship and the traditions assigned to it. In recent years, the revitalization of karakoa ship-building and its usage are being pushed by some scholars from Pampanga."),

	"Karakoa were similar to and were sometimes confused with balangay, but can be differentiated in that they possessed raised decks (burulan) amidships and on the outriggers. They also had sharply curved prows and sterns, giving the ships a characteristic crescent shape. Their design was also sleeker and faster than balangay, even though karakoa were usually much larger. Like balangay, they can be used for both trade and war. Their main use, however, were as warships and troop transports during the traditional seasonal sea raids (mangayaw) or piracy (especially against European trade ships). They were estimated to have speeds of up to 12 to 15 knots"),

	"Karakoa were an integral part of the traditional sea raiding (mangayaw) of Filipino thalassocracies. They were maritime expeditions (usually seasonal) against enemy villages for the purposes of gaining prestige through combat, taking plunder, and capturing slaves or hostages (sometimes brides). Before a raid, Visayans performed a ceremony called the pagdaga, where the prow and the keel of the karakoa warships were smeared with blood drawn from a captured member of the target enemy settlement. Karakoa and attending smaller ships usually raid in fleets called an abay. A fast scout ship, called a dulawan or lampitaw, is usually sent in advance of the abay. If intercepted by defending enemy ships, karakoa can engage in ship-to-ship battles called bangga. The pursuit of enemy ships is called banggal."),
	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_CVS_PHILIPPINES_UU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4",	
	"Warriors aboard karakoas were shielded from projectiles by removable panels of bamboo or woven nipa, in addition to kalasag personal shields. They were commonly armed with various swords like the kalis and metal-tipped spears called bangkaw. In addition, karakoa also had throwing javelins called sugob, which were thrown in large numbers at enemy ships. Unlike the bangkaw, they didn't have metal tips and were meant to be disposable. They were made from sharpened bagakay bamboo whose compartments were filled with sand to add weight for throwing. They sometimes had wooden tips laced with snake venom. Short-ranged bows (pana or busog) were also sometimes used in close-quarter volleys at enemy ships."),
	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_CVS_PHILIPPINES_UU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5",
	"Like other ships for trade and war in maritime Southeast Asia, karakoa were also usually armed with one or more bronze or brass swivel guns called lantaka, and sometimes also larger guns. There was a great deal of honor involved in participating in a raid. Exploits during raids were recorded permanently in the tattoos of Visayan warriors and nobility (timawa and tumao), earning them the name of pintados ('the painted ones') from the Spanish."),

	"The Katipunan was a Philippine revolutionary society founded by anti-Spanish Filipinos in Manila in 1892. Their primary aim was to gain independence from Spain through revolution. Based on recently found contemporary documents, the society has been organized as early as January 1892 but may have not became active until July 7 of the same year: the night Filipino writer Jose Rizal was banished to Dapitan. Founded by Filipino patriots Andres Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was initially a secret organization until its discovery in 1896, which led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution."),

	"The Tagalog word 'katipunan', literally meaning 'association', comes from the root word 'tipon', meaning 'gather'. Its official revolutionary name was 'Kataas-taasan, Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan' (literally: 'Supreme and Most Honorable Society of the Children of the Nation)."),

	"Being a secret organization, its members were sworn to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society. Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Liberty), which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its most prominent members."),

	"In planning the revolution, Andres Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, a delegation was sent to Emperor Meiji of Japan in order to solicit funds and military arms. The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities after a member named Teodoro Patiño revealed the Katipunan's illegal activities to his sister, and finally to the mother portress of Mandaluyong Orphanage. Seven days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, on December 26, 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cedulas (residence certificates and identity papers), culminating in the Cry of Pugad Lawin, the symbol of the beginning of the Philippine Revolution."),

	"The word palengke is a local variant of the Spanish word palenque, literally meaning '(wooden) palisade or stockade' and, by extension, the area enclosed by such a structure for defense, public festivals or some other purpose. The Spanish word is also used to describe a pathway or cluster of tables set up at some place of gathering such as a theatre, tournament or market, and it is from this latter sense that palengke likely derives its usage in the Filipino context."),

	"In the former Spanish colonies of New Spain in the Americas, a palenque also described a gathering-place of indios. One false etymology for palengke/palenque appearing in some popular sources mistakenly presumes that palenque is instead a word from the indigenous Mayan languages of Central America meaning 'gathering place', and that in colonial times the Spanish adopted it to describe a gathering of indigenous groups. While its use in Latin America to describe such a gathering is attested, the word itself originates from Spanish and not any of the indigenous languages; the mistaken belief of the word's indigenous origin is probably reinforced by Palenque, the famous Maya archaeological site in Chiapas, Mexico, which was named after the nearby Spanish village when the site was rediscovered in the mid-18th century."),

	"A palengke is usually composed of several dozen stalls arranged in rows under a shared roof. Management is usually handled by the local governmental units whose jurisdiction encompasses the physical location of the markets. Certain pieces of legislation, however, such as the Cooperatives Code and the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act, have prescribed that management of the markets be accomplished through cooperatives. There is little control over the day-to-day management of individual stalls, including commodity pricing, resulting in what has been called 'palengke mechanics.' The Philippine government retains partial control over the price of some commodities sold in palengkes, especially critical foods such as rice. The National Food Authority calls this regulation campaign (specifically for rice) 'Palengke Watch.'"),
